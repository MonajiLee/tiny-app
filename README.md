# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLsâ€“similar to [bit.ly](https://bitly.com/) or [Google URL Shortener](https://goo.gl/).

As a part of the web development curriculum at Lighthouse Labs (YVR), this was an individual evaluated project built over four days.
